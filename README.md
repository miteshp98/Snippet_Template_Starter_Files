Codewell's aim is to provide you with real-world design templates that you can use to practice your HTML and CSS projects.

Free or paid, all templates are high quality and will make great portfolio pieces.

### Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.

### I've completed the challenge, now what?

Hello Code Well team! I'm excited to submit my solution for Snippet Landing Page challenge. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in creating a responsive and interactive Snippet Landing Page.

Implemented a fully responsive design to ensure optimal viewing on various devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used :-

- HTML: Semantic tags such as nav, main, section, footer, and form are employed for better accessibility and SEO.
- CSS: Flexbox layout is used for arranging elements, media queries ensure responsiveness, clamp() function adjusts
  text size fluidly, and min-max properties control image sizing.
- Units: The project uses rem and % units for scalability and responsiveness.

### Features

- Flexbox Layout: Utilized for structuring the page elements and achieving a responsive design.
- Media Queries: Ensures the landing page adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Fluid Text Sizing: Text size adjusts smoothly across different viewport sizes using the clamp() function.
- Semantic HTML: Semantic tags improve accessibility and SEO, providing a clear structure for the page.

```css
body {
  background: url(../Assets/Background.png) no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
```
